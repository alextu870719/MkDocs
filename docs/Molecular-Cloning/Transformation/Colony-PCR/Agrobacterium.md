## **Materials**

* P10 pipette tips
* LB plate with appropriate antibiotic
* 3 ml LB in test tube with appropriate antibiotic
* 0.2 ml PCR tube with 50 μl MQ water

## **Procedure**
1. Prepare *Agrobacterium* suspension by inoculating a colony with a pipette tip in a 0.2 ml PCR tube containing 50 μl MQ water.
2. Backup the colony on the LB plate.
3. Dispose of the pipette tip in the test tube containing 3 ml LB (incubate at 28˚C, 200 rpm overnight).
4. Lyse *A. tumefaciens* suspension at 95˚C for 10 min using a thermocycler.
5. Prepare PCR solution (19 μl/colony) in a 0.2 ml PCR tube:

    | PCR Reagents | Volume for 19 μl |
    | --- | --- |
    | [PowerPol 2X PCR Mix with Dye (RK20719)](https://abclonal.com/molecular-biology/PowerPol2XPCRMixwithDye/RK20719){target="_blank"} | 10 µl |
    | Primer forward (10 μM) | 0.4 µl |
    | Primer reverse (10 μM) | 0.4 µl |
    | Water | 8.2 µl |

6. Add 1 μl of lysed *Agrobacterium* suspension to the PCR tube containing the PCR solution.

## **PCR Reaction**

| Step | Temperature (˚C) | Time | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 98 | 45 sec | |
| 2 | 98 | 10 sec | |
| 3 | Tm | 30 sec | |
| 4 | 72 | 1 kb/min | Return to step 2 for 30 cycles |
| 5 | 72 | 5 min | |

!!! info "Note"
    * This protocol works for both *Agrobacterium* and *Rhizobium* spp.
    * It is not nessesarry to do colony PCR for *Agrobacterium*.
