## **Materials**

* P10 pipette tips
* LB plate with appropriate antibiotic
* 3 ml LB in test tube with appropriate antibiotic

## **Procedure**
1. Prepare PCR solution 20 μl/colony in a 0.2 ml PCR tube.

    | PCR Reagents | Volume for 20 μl |
    | --- | --- |
    | [PowerPol 2X PCR Mix with Dye (RK20719)](https://abclonal.com/molecular-biology/PowerPol2XPCRMixwithDye/RK20719) | 10 µl |
    | Primer forward (10 μM) | 0.4 µl |
    | Primer reverse (10 μM) | 0.4 µl |
    | Water | 9.2 µl |

2. Use a pipette tip to pick a colony.
3. Inoculate the colony into the PCR tube containing the PCR solution.
4. Backup the colony on the LB plate.
5. Throw the pipette tip in the test tube containing 3 ml LB.
6. Incubate at 37˚C, 200 rpm overnight.

*Note: 3 ml LB is for plasmid isolation tomorrow.*
