# **Blue-White Screening**

## **Introduction**
α-Complementation is a technique that utilizes β-galactosidase in molecular cloning. In bacteria with a deletion in the lacZ ω gene, β-galactosidase remains inactive. However, when these bacteria acquire a plasmid containing the lacZ α gene segment, which complements the deletion, functional β-galactosidase is restored. During the cloning process, if a foreign DNA fragment is inserted into the lacZ α gene on the plasmid, it disrupts α-complementation. As a result, recombinant bacteria fail to produce functional β-galactosidase.
## **Stocks Preparation**

=== "20 mg/ml X-Gal"
    Prepare 20 mg/ml X-Gal ([GoldBio #X4281C](https://goldbio.com/product/2002/x-gal)) in DMF or DMSO.
    !!! info "Note"
        **Store at -20˚C in a dark tube or cover with aluminum foil to protect from light.**

=== "100 mM IPTG"
    Prepare 100 mM IPTG ([GoldBio #I2481C](https://goldbio.com/product/1379/iptg)) in MQ water and store at -20˚C.
    !!! info "Note"
        **Store at -20˚C**

## **Application**
=== "Mix with Agar (Recommend)"
    * Autoclave the agar medium and cool to 65˚C.
    * Add 10 µl of 20 mg/ml X-Gal per ml medium (**500 µl** [50 ml]).
    * Add 10 µl of 100 mM IPTG per ml medium (**500 µl** [50 ml]).

=== "Surface spread"
    * Spread 40 µl of 100 mM IPTG and 120 µl of 20 mg/ml X-Gal to the surface of each plate.

## **Troubleshooting**

!!! info "Note"
    Q: Why are colonies all blue?
    
    A: Check *E. coli* strain, only strain with **lacZΔM15** mutation can be used for blue-white screening: XL1-Blue, DH5α, DH10ß, JM109
