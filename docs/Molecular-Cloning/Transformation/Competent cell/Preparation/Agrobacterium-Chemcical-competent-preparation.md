1. Culture *Agrobacterium/Rhizobium* from -80 fridge on plain LB plate, grow overnight (sometime 2 days) at 28°C.
2. Culture sigle colony of *Agrobacterium/Rhizobium* in 5 mL of plain LB overnight at 28°C, 200 rpm.
3. Add 5 mL overnight culture to 250 mL LB in a 250 mL flask at 28°C, 200 rpm until culture reaches OD600 of 0.5 to 1.0 (~3-4 hours).

    !!! note
