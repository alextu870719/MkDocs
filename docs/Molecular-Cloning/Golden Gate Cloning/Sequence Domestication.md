## **Domestication new modules**

There are three solutions if there are internal type IIs restriction enzyme sites of new modules.

1. Keep the internal type IIs restriction enzyme sites, if this module is not going to use commonly, the cloning could still work, but with less efficiency.

2. Synthesize the sequence by company and use [codon optimization tool](https://www.idtdna.com/pages/tools/codon-optimization-tool?returnurl=%2FCodonOpt) to remove type IIs restriction enzyme sites.

3. Site-directed mutagenesis.

### Golden Gate Assembly-Site-Directed Mutagenesis

1. Design primer at [GoldenMutagenesis](https://msbi.ipb-halle.de/GoldenMutagenesisWeb/) or [GB Domesticator](https://gbcloning.upv.es/do/domestication/)

2. Input your target coding sequence, and select type IIs restriction enzymes (For MoClo, BsaI and BbsI need to be domesticated).
