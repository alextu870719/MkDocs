| **Inserted Sequence Deconvolution** | Limited to single base pair insertion                           | Displays inserted sequences as unknown nucleotides (N)                | Can fully deconvolve inserted sequences                                | Displays inserted sequences as unknown nucleotides (N)                       |
| **Advantages**         | - May provide more accurate indel frequency values for samples with low indel frequency (<10%)<br>- Easy to use | - Provides the most accurate indel frequency values for most samples<br>- Can fully deconvolve inserted sequences | - Easy to use<br>- May provide more accurate indel frequency values for samples with low indel frequency (<10%) |                                                                              |
| **Disadvantages**      | - Underestimates high indel frequency samples<br>- Cannot provide inserted sequence information | - May ignore low signal peaks in the low indel frequency range        | - May be less accurate than TIDE and SeqScreener in the low indel frequency range | - Cannot provide window size information                                      |

## **Conclusion**
- DECODR provides the most accurate indel frequency estimates in most cases, especially when samples contain a high proportion of indels.
- TIDE and SeqScreener may be more accurate in the low indel frequency range.
- DECODR is the only tool that can fully deconvolve inserted sequences, which is particularly useful for clonal cell analysis that requires indel sequence information.
- For knock-in frequency analysis, TIDER is the preferred tool.
- The appropriate tool should be carefully selected based on the specific requirements of the genome editing method.
