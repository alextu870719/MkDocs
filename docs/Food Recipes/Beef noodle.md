- 30 or more cloves of garlic
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 175-350 g Sichuan-style broad bean sauce (Lee Kum Kee; Seoul Asian Market)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Beef Broth**:
    - Place the beef shank in **cold water** (80% water level), add 2-3 green onions, 1 whole ginger root, and 2 tbsp rice cooking wine. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
    - Remove the cooked beef and let it cool. Discard the green onions and ginger, and use a strainer or spoon to remove the scum from the broth.
    - Once cooled, cut the beef shank into the desired size.

2. **Make the Soup Base**:
    - Prepare garlic confit in a deep medium pot over low heat until the garlic becomes soft and golden brown (20-30 minutes).
    - Add the sliced onion and cook until caramelized (10-20 minutes).

    !!! info "I haven't tried this, but I think you can use an oven to achieve a similar result."

3. **Simmer the Soup**:
    - Add 175-350 g Sichuan-style broad bean sauce, 1 cup soy sauce, 1 tbsp sugar, 3 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns, 3 tbsp rice cooking wine, the spice pouch, tomatoes (optional), and chili pepper (optional) to the pot. Bring to a boil.
    - Place everything in a large tea bag (available at Seoul Asian Market) and transfer it to the beef broth from step 1.
    - Add the cut beef from step 1 to the beef broth.
    - Adjust the saltiness to taste.
    - Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Let it rest at room temperature overnight.

4. **Cook the Noodles**:
    - Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.

5. **Assemble the Dish**:
    - Place the cooked noodles in a bowl. Ladle the beef and soup over the noodles.
    - Top with green onions and chili oil, if desired.

## Notes
- The primary flavors come from the beef broth, garlic, onion, bean sauce, soy sauce, and Sichuan peppercorns.
- Adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- For a spicier version, increase the amount of Sichuan peppercorns or add more chili peppers to the soup base.
